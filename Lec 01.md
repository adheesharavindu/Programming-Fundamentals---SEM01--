# (01)What is a computer :
## A machine that performs calculations and processes information according to the given instructions.

# (02)Computer programs and programming : 

## Program

### Sequence of instructions for the computer to follow in a perform a task

## Programming

### Analyzing a problem into steps and giving instructions to the computer in a language it can understand. 

# (03)Computer language:

## set of symbols, special words and rules for constructing programs.

## (a)Low Level Languages

- ### Machine Language (binary code)

- ### Assembly Language  (English-like abbreviations for elementary operations)


## (b)High Level Languages


### (*) Language translators:

 - #### Assembler (translates assembly language to machine language)
 
 - #### Interpreter (translates and executes each line of source code as it is encountered)
 
- #### Compiler (translates an entire high-level language program into machine language at once)

### (*)Types of errors:

- ### Syntax errors (incorrect statement construction)

- ### Run-time errors (errors that occur during program execution)

- ### Logical errors (errors resulting from faulty logic)

### (*)Testing and debugging:

- #### Testing involves running the program with representative data sets to check its performance.

- #### Debugging is the process of eliminating errors (bugs) from a program.

#### process of writing programs is called programming
